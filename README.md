# Individual_Project
The following files contain the code used in my thesis which evaluates Neural Network performances using a 3D LED cube. 

The file for the 3D LED Cube is written in C and should be imported in the Arduino IDE. 

The files for the Convolutional and Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network (NN) are written in MATLAB and should hence be imported into MATLAB.
